# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-Using-MySQL
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of the Walmart sales dataset through MySQL. The primary objectives are data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract actionable insights and uncover significant trends.

-- Drop the database if it exists
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS salesDataWalmart;

-- Create a new database named salesDataWalmart if it does not already exist
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS salesDataWalmart;

-- Select the newly created database for use
USE salesDataWalmart;

-- Drop the WALMARTSALES table if it exists to avoid duplication
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS WALMARTSALES;

-- Create the WALMARTSALES table with the specified schema
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS WALMARTSALES(
    INVOICE_ID VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    BRANCH VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    CITY VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
